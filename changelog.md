# Welcome to the Beta!
Hey there! You are on the Beta Branch. If you ever have any feedback please do share with us over on [Github](https://github.com/dylanpiera/Foundry-Pokemon-Tabletop-United-System/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/fE3w59q)

## 2.0-Beta-2


## 2.0-Beta-1
It's finally time for another big release everyone!

### Update Storytime
VoidPhoenix (the developer of the Move Master module for PTU) and I decided a couple weeks—if not months—ago to migrate Move Master as a core functionality of the PTU System!

I had always planned to have some implementation of a sidebar mechanic for the PTU system, but when Void first started work on the Move Master Module he just couldn't wait for me to get there so made it himself!

This however means that Move Master is a little... unstable. Don't take me wrong! Void did an amazing job making what he did, but because it wasn't fully integrated into the system, and didn't know its full scope at the start of the project it became unsustainable. 

But fear no longer!
As Move Master is now a main feature in the PTU for FoundryVTT system!

### The Actual Update
This is the first 2.0 Beta, where we have integrated a huge chunk of Move Master and improved upon all of the parts we have implemented.
Some of the features as of now are unfinished, and this might dissapoint some of you who enjoyed these features. But fear not, we will be adding them all back, better than ever before in one of the upcomming beta versions! The full timeline I'll describe down below.

#### V2.0 & V2.1 Timeline
Version 2.0 will contain the "basic" version of the PTU Sidebar, but will miss a couple of features. Most notably custom move/item effects.
For version 2.1 we will be implementing a new 'Effect' system where using a (hopefully) intuitive UI anyone can create dynamic move effects for all the automation and homebrew goodness. This system will however be pretty big, so we decided to turn these into seperate updates, so we can still get the majority of the new features & bugfixes out while we work on it.

**Move Master features that are missing for 2.0 but planned for 2.1**: 
- Move Effects
- (Use) Item Effects
- Orders
- Maneuvers

**Move Master features that are planned for 2.0 but not in the current beta**:
- Resting Automation
- Auto roll initative when new token is created during combat
- Struggle Menu

### The Actual Changelog
Oh- boi, this is 2 months worth of features... but here we go!
#### New Features:
- Integrated Move Master into PTU Main System.
- Added the 'Damage Applicator' chat message, allowing both GMs/Players to select how damage should be applied to targets.
- Item Icons & Pokemon Images are now included with the system. A 'lite' version without these will be released with the 2.0 update.
- Item Compendium has icons pre-assigned.
- Added seperate value/mod for the 'mod' and 'stage' fields of both Characters and Pokemon

#### New Features (Move Master)
These features were already in Move Master, but I've summarised them here for those who didn't use the module before:
- Add a Sidebar that shows when you have selected a token, displaying useful combat information.
- Automatically track Standard actions for conditions like Burn/Poison.
- Added Last Chance & Type Strategist automation.
- Added Double-Strike & Five-Strike Automation.
- Automated Stored Power & Punishment DB calculation.
- Automatically apply Technician.
- Added Automatic Injury Application (configurable in settings).
- Automatic Pokemon Capture mechanic, including calculation & transfering of ownership.
- Added SFX to moves & certain other actions.
- Added Animations for moves and certain other actions if [Sequencer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer) and/or [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/) is installed.
- Integration for [JB2A's Premium Animation Assets](https://www.patreon.com/JB2A) module with the above two modules.
- Added Automatic Item Icon Assignment whenever you open an item sheet with the default image set, if an image is found it will be set. (Configurable in settings)

#### Bugfixes:
- Fixed all bugs with the Owner field.
- Fixed infinite spiraling Burn/Poison stage dropping.
- Fixed Dex Experience not properly calculating.
- Fixed 'EditLock' flag on Effects not applying properly.
- Fixed several small style issues in Character Sheet.

## 1.5-Beta 15.4 - Owner Bug Hotfix
- Fixes the 'Owner' field on Pokemon.

## 1.5-Beta 15.3 - AE Bug Hotfix
- Fixed AEs not applying properly in Foundry v9

## 1.5-Beta 15 - Foundry 9 Compatibility (Hotfix)
A quick hotfix for a couple v9 compatibility bugs that slipped past the last patch:

- Fixed an issue where an error would prevent saving PTU Settings.
- Fixed an issue where players could not delete tokens.
- Fixed an error that occured when the user rolled damage on a move from the sheet.

## 1.5-Beta-14 - Foundry 9 Compatibility
Hey all, just two things for today.

- Migrated to Foundry core version 9
- Added support for .webm images during pokemon generation.

Thanks to VoidPhoenix#6487 for this update!

## 1.5-Beta-11 - 13 - Custom Typings!
Hey all! For the 2nd part of the Homebrew update I present: the Custom Type Editor!

Currently both the CSE & CTE are still lacking in some features, namely the species editor is missing evolution settings, while the type editor is missing a way to add your own images. Both of these will be added in an upcoming beta.
For now I thought I'd let you guys play around with the new CTE first!

- Added support for Custom Types using the Custom Type Editor.
- Existing type effectiveness can now be modded if so desired.

Please note: By default types are only updated on actors after a refresh, if you want to you can use the 'Sync Changes' button in the CTE to apply it to all currently logged in players (including yourself).
This however forces every single Pokémon in your game to refresh it's data, so if you have a lot of mons, this can create a lot of lagg. 

## 1.5-Beta-10
- Hotfix for 'null' typing showing up in mons with only a single type.

## 1.5-Beta-9 - Custom Species Editor Upgrade
Hi all! This is a bigger beta release as the CSE- Custom Species Editor, has received a complete overhaul!

- Added new Custom Species Editor.
- Added support for Moves & Abilities to the CSE.
- Added drag & drop support to the CSE for Moves, Abilities & Other Capabilities.
- Added support for mons with more than 2 types
- Replaced 'null' typing with 'Untyped' for internal calculations.

## 1.5-Beta-8 - Small Patch
- Fixed Evolution entries for some Pokémon that would break their generation.
- Added an option for the Virtuoso Dice Pool Limit to be ignored.

## 1.5-Beta-7 - Fixes & Small Enhancements
Today we have mostly bug fixes and small enhancements.

### Enhancements:
- Added Uranium & Sage dex Compendium.
- Skill dice pools now max out at 6 dice, so virutoso doesn't change the pool to 8d6.
- Moves with "--" initiative will now always hit.
- Blindness now applies the accuracy lowering debuff through AE instead of a hidden modifier.
- Throwing Mastery edge now has an AE that increases the Actor's throwing range capability by 2.

### Bugfixes:
- Fixed Darmanitan-Normal being unable to be generated.
- Fixed Move-snippets not working at all for Trainer Moves.

## 1.5-Beta-6 - Dex Drag-in Update
Hey everyone! It's been a while since I've last seen you guys. It's been about a month and a half since the last beta release, yikes!
Either way, I needed a summer break, but now I'm back and ready to continue work on the system. So expect more updates in the near future!

For today I've brought you changes in regards to the Dex Drag-In system courtesy of VoidPhoenix, thanks a ton man for adding these missing features, and sorry that it took a while before I could validate them haha.

### Dex Drag-In changes
- Newly generated actors are put in a folder with the same name as the current scene.
- Added support for (random) Shiny Generation.

- Add "Send to Chat" buttons to Pokémon & Trainer sheets for all items.
- Add prePlayerDeleteToken hook for module developers.
- Fixed some typos in settings.

## 1.5-Beta-3 - Move Origins
- Automatically guess the origin of a move on a Pokémon's sheet.
  - Whenever you add a move to a mon, it will check it's Level-Up, Egg, TM & Tutor list (in that order) to see how it is supposed to get this move, and set that as the assumed origin

## 1.5-Beta-2 - Where's Sentret?
- Added Sentret dex entry to compendium
- Fixed the 'ActorGenerator.Create' method to allow quick creation of actors that already exist.

## 1.5-Beta-1 - Auto Delete Volatile Conditions

  - This can be disabled in the settings.

## 1.5-Beta-0 - Release 1.4 Dev Branch
Welcome on the 1.5 dev branch, this is the exact same codebase as the 1.4.0 release.

## 1.4.0 - Foundry 0.8 Release!
Hey everyone! With the release of PTUVTT 1.4.0 we now have officially moved over to support Foundry 0.8.6!

While this version won't be adding as many new features as many of the other major system updates, Foundry 0.8 support in and off itself can be considered a main feature, as it brings lots of new improvements both for Players, GMs as well as system & module developers like myself!

Nonetheless, there are still some new features to the system, so please do read them down below!

### New Features
- Upgraded support for Foundry 0.8.6, and dropped support for foundry 0.7.*
- Effects applied to Embedded Documents such as Items can now apply effects to their parent.
f.e.: Skill Improvement (Acrobatics) Poké Edge has an effect with change key: '../data.skills.acrobatics.value.mod'
  - Both '../' and 'actor.' prefix allow manipulation of Parent
  - This works on any item type, and can be accessed through the 'effects' tab bar button
  - [**BREAKING**]: Please note that due to this all Skill Improvement edges will need to be re-added to an actor for the change to reflect in their sheet
- Dragging an Item on a Player Sheet which has the exact same name as an item already in the sheet, will now increase the Quantity of the old item, instead of adding a new entry.
- Players can now Delete their own Tokens in a Scene.
  - This can be turned off by GM in the System Settings screen.

### Bugfixes:
- Fixed Confusion always applying damage instead of flipping a coin, and applying the wrong amount of damage.
- Fixed Indeedee data error which made them unable to be generated.
- Fixed having combatants their initiative tiebreaker being set to .02 instead of the .20 it was, whenever their base init value was updated.

### Other:
- Item Categories are now collapsible, but won't remember their status when the sheet is updated.
- Completely overhauled the back-end of the Charactermancer allowing for much smoother development of new features for it.
- Added minor improvements to old charactermancer system, including a GM setting to disable evolution previews.
- Added the 'Execute-as-GM' api inspired by the [Bad Ideas Toolkit](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/bad-ideas-toolkit) allowing both the System and Module devs to make use of GM Escalation for handling automation. For api info see [api.js](https://github.com/dylanpiera/Foundry-Pokemon-Tabletop-United-System/blob/master/module/api/api.js#L232)

## 1.3.2 - Fix Combat Visibility

But, let us talk about the update, shall we! It's been 2 months in the making after all.

This update was all focused around Automation & Quality of Life features, adding things like combat damage calculation, status effect automation, active effects implementations, and much more.
